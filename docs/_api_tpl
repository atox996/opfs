# API

The "@atox/opfs" library provides three entry functions: "file," "write," and "dir," for accessing files and directories.

```ts
import { file, write, dir, type OTFile, type OTDir } from "@atox/opfs";
```

## file

```ts
<file-api>
```

## directory

```ts
<dir-api>
```

## OPFS

```ts
<opfs-api>
```
